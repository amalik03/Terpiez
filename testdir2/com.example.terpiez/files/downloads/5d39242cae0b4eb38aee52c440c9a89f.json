{"name":"Featherfang","description":"The Featherfang is unique among Terpiez for having feathers on its teeth, which is how it gets its name. It is a filter feeder, with its tooth-feathers capturing gnats and mosquitoes, though it also likes cinnamon-sugar dust from breakfast cereals. Featherfangs vocalize through their teeth, producing a sound very similar to that of an oboe.","thumbnail":"a7e833318313495aadb2111887e3df97","image":"4b2aec98b41946a18507c65432f9e81a","stats":{"Avuncularity":3,"Destrucity":7,"Panache":8,"Spiciness":7}}
