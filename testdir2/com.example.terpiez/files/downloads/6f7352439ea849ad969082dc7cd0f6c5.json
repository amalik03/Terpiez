{"name":"Striped Shrieker","description":"You will never have any trouble finding a Striped Shrieker, because it shreiks. Constantly. And loudly. According to reports by terpieologists, some Striped Shriekers have been found to continue shrieking up to an hour after death. The only time a Striped Shrieker stops shrieking is when it is eating noodles, and then only as it eats each individual noodle. Between noodes? You'd better believe it's shrieking!","thumbnail":"99ffc36b5af94564bf676d5ef58e74bc","image":"8dbb37fffbe7459bbb0718bf147a5fc6","stats":{"Avuncularity":5,"Destrucity":8,"Panache":4,"Spiciness":8}}
