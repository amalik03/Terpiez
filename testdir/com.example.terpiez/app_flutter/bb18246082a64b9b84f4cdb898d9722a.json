{"name":"Boneboulder","description":"The Boneboulder is indigenous to the Boulder River area of southwestern Montana, where it largely subsists on the bones of cattle that have been mutilated by aliens. Given its preference, however, the Boneboulder is largely herbivorous, favoring asparagus especially. The call of the Boneboulder is a melody played on hand-made pipes made of the smaller rib bones that lack sufficient nutrients to consume, and which sounds remarkably similar to 'Three Blind Mice'.","thumbnail":"967a4c8cdeda4606b1c65de3bfec784b","image":"dc2d6ffc360c422f9861db47001b698a","stats":{"Avuncularity":7,"Destrucity":7,"Panache":5,"Spiciness":6}}
