{"name":"Wonderworm","description":"The Wonderworm is an avid composter, and is able to transform a cubic foot of dry leaves and grass clippings into high-quality soil in half an hour. It mostly uses this to grow tomatoes, which invariably die before producing any fruit. They are almost completely silent, and one might be sneaking up behind you right now and you would never know it until it was too late.","thumbnail":"0f2fac64527d42878b1578ce49eeed55","image":"9e2e0aea1f2b4cc2853df54bff7f57f9","stats":{"Avuncularity":4,"Destrucity":9,"Panache":3,"Spiciness":9}}
