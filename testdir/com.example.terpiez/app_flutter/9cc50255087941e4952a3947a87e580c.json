{"name":"Fallowfern","description":"Fallowferns are often found around the edges of unplanted agricultural fields, particularly those adjacent to wooded areas. They enjoy smoked salmon, but as this is seldom found in their native habitat they often settle for corn kernels or other grass seeds. They can be recognized by their call, which has been likened to the Bee Gees.","thumbnail":"668f4cf25969487ba7e7af5f1744dfa3","image":"96fdbb749f7043399d4463a1564a8ccd","stats":{"Avuncularity":6,"Destrucity":4,"Panache":8,"Spiciness":7}}
