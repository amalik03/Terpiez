{"name":"Petalqueen","description":"The Petalqueen is an impressive horticulturalist, particularly with ornamental flowers. It regularly grows large patches of varied blooms in aesthetically pleasing arrangements. Interestingly, it does not do this for the visual appeal, but rather because they taste colors, and like a varied diet. The call of the Petalqueen sounds like bridge of Tower of Power's 'Soul with a Captial S'.","thumbnail":"37125b80b88d48d4a260d0099b2f8eb5","image":"6ed151b83cb54942b47e821d068d2b70","stats":{"Avuncularity":4,"Destrucity":7,"Panache":7,"Spiciness":7}}
