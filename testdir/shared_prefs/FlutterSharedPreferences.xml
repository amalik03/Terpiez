It also frequently uses these for party tricks, though these tricks almost never impress the other party-goers. Their diet consists primarily of sweet liquids, such as sugar water or cola, typically consumed through silly straws.&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;508d9483cf754827923001e9ef039781&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;ae71f4c49ea047019cfb37c86f626833&quot;,&quot;stats&quot;:{&quot;Avuncularity&quot;:10,&quot;Destrucity&quot;:6,&quot;Panache&quot;:2,&quot;Spiciness&quot;:7},&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;lat&quot;:38.9894511,&quot;lon&quot;:-76.9364147},{&quot;lat&quot;:38.9894511,&quot;lon&quot;:-76.9364147}]},&quot;bb18246082a64b9b84f4cdb898d9722a&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;bb18246082a64b9b84f4cdb898d9722a&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Boneboulder&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The Boneboulder is indigenous to the Boulder River area of southwestern Montana, where it largely subsists on the bones of cattle that have been mutilated by aliens. Given its preference, however, the Boneboulder is largely herbivorous, favoring asparagus especially. The call of the Boneboulder is a melody played on hand-made pipes made of the smaller rib bones that lack sufficient nutrients to consume, and which sounds remarkably similar to 'Three Blind Mice'.&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;967a4c8cdeda4606b1c65de3bfec784b&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;dc2d6ffc360c422f9861db47001b698a&quot;,&quot;stats&quot;:{&quot;Avuncularity&quot;:7,&quot;Destrucity&quot;:7,&quot;Panache&quot;:5,&quot;Spiciness&quot;:6},&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;lat&quot;:38.9903203,&quot;lon&quot;:-76.9354077}]},&quot;d54edc4409bb45a8841268f9d49a355c&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d54edc4409bb45a8841268f9d49a355c&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Petalqueen&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The Petalqueen is an impressive horticulturalist, particularly with ornamental flowers. It regularly grows large patches of varied blooms in aesthetically pleasing arrangements. Interestingly, it does not do this for the visual appeal, but rather because they taste colors, and like a varied diet. The call of the Petalqueen sounds like bridge of Tower of Power's 'Soul with a Captial S'.&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;37125b80b88d48d4a260d0099b2f8eb5&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;6ed151b83cb54942b47e821d068d2b70&quot;,&quot;stats&quot;:{&quot;Avuncularity&quot;:4,&quot;Destrucity&quot;:7,&quot;Panache&quot;:7,&quot;Spiciness&quot;:7},&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;lat&quot;:38.990714,&quot;lon&quot;:-76.9355806}]},&quot;9cc50255087941e4952a3947a87e580c&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;9cc50255087941e4952a3947a87e580c&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Fallowfern&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Fallowferns are often found around the edges of unplanted agricultural fields, particularly those adjacent to wooded areas. They enjoy smoked salmon, but as this is seldom found in their native habitat they often settle for corn kernels or other grass seeds. They can be recognized by their call, which has been likened to the Bee Gees.&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;668f4cf25969487ba7e7af5f1744dfa3&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;96fdbb749f7043399d4463a1564a8ccd&quot;,&quot;stats&quot;:{&quot;Avuncularity&quot;:6,&quot;Destrucity&quot;:4,&quot;Panache&quot;:8,&quot;Spiciness&quot;:7},&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;lat&quot;:38.989787,&quot;lon&quot;:-76.935923}]}}</string>
